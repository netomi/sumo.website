It was started in 2001 by employees of the Institute of Transportation Systems at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). SUMO allows modelling of intermodal traffic systems - including road vehicles, public transport and pedestrians. Included with SUMO is a wealth of supporting tools that automate core tasks for the creation, the execution and evaluation of traffic simulations, such as network import, route calculations, visualization and emission calculation.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://www.eclipse.dev/sumo/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.eclipse.dev/sumo/contact/</guid><description>Mailing lists

It gathers international participants from the industry, research and public institutions - to present (among others) projects, studies and advancements all around traffic, simulation and SUMO.
The conference is a great place to learn about new features, network with fellow enthusiasts, ask the developers, have fruitful discussions, exchange ideas and even start collaborations!</description></item></channel></rss>
